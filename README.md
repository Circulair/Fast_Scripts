# Fast_Scripts

These scripts works with Kali Linux!

These are created to make a sort of shortcuts:_
You can excecute these 'fast scripts' with the following command:_
"sudo bash <directory to script>"_
If you want to excecute the script by administrator A.K.A. root,_
then you need the "sudo" command (displayed above)_
If you're smart: create a folder on your desktop named: fastscripts_
Then you can create new scripts or copy them from this repository to your _
fastscripts folder._
now open a terminal window and type the following commands: (without the $)_
$ cd Desktop_
$ cd fastscripts_
$ ls _
(now you can see al the files in the current directory with the "ls" command)_
Now choose a script you want to excecute: for example: testscript_
$ sudo bash testscript_
now your script will be excecuted._
my sugestion is to use sudo because the you know you're good_
btw. when you get an error: please first try the excecute command without sudo, for example:_
$ bash testscript_
