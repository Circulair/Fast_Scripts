# Fast_Scripts

These scripts works with Kali Linux!

These are created to make a sort of shortcuts: <br />
You can excecute these 'fast scripts' with the following command: <br />
"sudo bash <directory to script>" <br />
If you want to excecute the script by administrator A.K.A. root, <br />
then you need the "sudo" command (displayed above) <br />
If you're smart: create a folder on your desktop named: fastscripts <br />
Then you can create new scripts or copy them from this repository to your <br />
fastscripts folder. <br />
now open a terminal window and type the following commands: (without the $) <br />
$ cd Desktop <br />
$ cd fastscripts <br />
$ ls <br />
(now you can see al the files in the current directory with the "ls" command) <br />
Now choose a script you want to excecute: for example: testscript <br />
$ sudo bash testscript<br />
now your script will be excecuted. <br />
my sugestion is to use sudo because the you know you're good <br />
btw. when you get an error: please first try the excecute command without sudo, for example: <br />
$ bash testscript <br />
