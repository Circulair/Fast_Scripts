# Fast_Scripts

These scripts works with Kali Linux!

These are created to make a sort of shortcuts:
You can excecute these 'fast scripts' with the following command:
"sudo bash <directory to script>"
If you want to excecute the script by administrator A.K.A. root, 
then you need the "sudo" command (displayed above)
If you're smart: create a folder on your desktop named: fastscripts
Then you can create new scripts or copy them from this repository to your 
fastscripts folder.
now open a terminal window and type the following commands: (without the $)
$ cd Desktop
$ cd fastscripts
$ ls 
(now you can see al the files in the current directory with the "ls" command)
Now choose a script you want to excecute: for example: testscript
$ sudo bash testscript
now your script will be excecuted.
my sugestion is to use sudo because the you know you're good
btw. when you get an error: please first try the excecute command without sudo, for example:
$ bash testscript
